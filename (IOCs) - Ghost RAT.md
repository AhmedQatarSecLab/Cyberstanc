# ðŸš¨ Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) - Ghost RAT

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This document outlines behavior-based Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) extracted during the analysis of Ghost RAT using **Vortex (powered by Cyberstanc)**.  
These IOCs highlight the malwareâ€™s core capabilities: persistence, injection, evasion, and system manipulation.

## ðŸ§  Summary

These IOCs reflect Ghost RATâ€™s operational goals: stealthy installation, persistence, host control, and sandbox evasion.  
They are critical for detection and threat hunting across endpoints and networks.

**Stay curious. Stay safe. Stay ahead.**
